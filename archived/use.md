Mono is positioned to be the leading platform for development of Gnome applications on Linux and is an open-source alternative for Microsoft Windows development. The following links should help you get started with Mono:

-   [Downloads](/Downloads "Downloads")
-   [The Monkeyguide tutorial](/Monkeyguide "Monkeyguide")
-   [How-To pages](/Howto "Howto")
-   [API Documentation](http://www.go-mono.com/docs/)
-   [Mailing Lists](/Mailing_Lists "Mailing Lists") to get help
-   [Bug reporting](/Bugs "Bugs") to help us improve the software
-   Commercial [Support](/Support "Support")
-   And [Novell Forge](/Novell_Forge "Novell Forge") is available for collaborative development
-   [Supported Platforms](/Supported_Platforms "Supported Platforms") lists all the platforms currently supported by Mono.

Core Components
===============

The Mono platform consists of the C# compiler, the just-in-time runtime, and other associated components:

-   [C# Compiler](/CSharp_Compiler "CSharp Compiler")
-   [Mono Runtime](/Mono:Runtime "Mono:Runtime")
-   [Debugger](/Debugger "Debugger"), [Debugger Tutorial](/Guide:Debugger "Guide:Debugger") and [Debugging](/Debugging "Debugging") techniques.

Mono supports several technologies for developing GUI desktop applications. Gtk# is a mature binding to the Gtk platform, which is used primarily for Gnome in Linux but also works in Windows with a native feel. System.Windows.Forms is in active development. CocoaSharp is used for developing Mac OSX applications.

-   [Gtk#](/GtkSharp "GtkSharp")
-   [WinForms](/WinForms "WinForms")
-   [CocoaSharp](/MonoMac)

Web applications are an integral part of the Mono platform as well. ASP.NET 1.0 applications can be run within the Apache web server using mod_mono or through a light-weight standalone C# web server called XSP. ASP.NET 2.0 support is in development. Infrastructure for web services and database access through a number of providers is also provided with Mono.

-   [ASP.NET](/ASP.NET "ASP.NET")
-   [Web Services](/Web_Services "Web Services")
-   [Database Access](/Database_Access "Database Access")

Mono comprises many other technologies as well, including cryptography, code access security, and internationalization.

-   [Cryptography Overview](/Cryptography "Cryptography")
-   [Security](/FAQ:_Security "FAQ: Security") (SSL/TLS, authenticode, PKI, CAS)
-   [Internationalization (I18N)](/Internationalization "Internationalization")
-   [Other Libraries](/Libraries "Libraries")

Mono offers various ways of tuning your application:

-   [HeapShot](/HeapShot "HeapShot") live memory profiler.
-   [HeapBuddy](/HeapBuddy "HeapBuddy") total memory profiler.
-   [Code Coverage](/Code_Coverage "Code Coverage") for evaluating your tests.
-   [Profile](/Profile "Profile") for more information on profiling.
