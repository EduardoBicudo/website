title: Mono 4.2.0 Release Notes
---

Highlights
----------

* Adoption of Microsoft's open source code

Microsoft Source Code Adoption
==============================

This is the second release of Mono that replaces various components of
Mono with code that was released by Microsoft under the MIT license in
one of three places:

* Microsoft's ReferenceSource drop
* Microsoft's CoreFX
* Microsoft's CoreCLR

While Microsoft is working towards .NET Core: a redistributable and
re-imagined version of .NET, the project remains a work in progress.
Mono at this point continues to provide an API that tracks the .NET
desktop/server version.

This means that most of the code that we have integrated comes from
the ReferenceSource drop.  In the future, we will deliver a "Mono
Core" along the same lines of .NET Core to allow the use of the Mono
runtime with the new library distribution system that is being
developed with CoreFX.

In this release, we have either ported components that were either
incomplete or buggy in Mono and were relatively easy to port to Mono.
There is much more to be done in this area.  If you are interested in
tracking those efforts, check the project status:

Mono ships now with a subset of the referencesource that have been
adjusted to work with Mono's class libraries or have been updated to
be cross platform.

### System.XML ###

We have replaced most of Mono's System.XML implementation with
Microsoft's version.  We only kept Mono's Xml Serializer as this one
works on statically compiled systems (like iOS).
